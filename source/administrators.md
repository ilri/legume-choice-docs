# Administrator Guidance

Administrators of the legumeCHOICE tool have the ability to view and update the raw data collected by users of the tool. To access the raw data, administrators should visit [this page](https://l-gorman.com/AdminLegumeCHOICE/). They will be prompted to enter a username and password which are known only to administrators.

Administrators can download the raw data in JSON format. To view how to load and submit data, administrators should refer to the _managing data_ section of [Using the App](legume-choice-app.md)
