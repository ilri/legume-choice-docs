# Overview

The legumeCHOICE tool is made up of multiple components. The frontend is written using ReactJS. This is hosted on github pages. The server, api, data-processing scripts and database are hosted on a linux virtual machine running Ubuntu 20.04. We use an NGINX server, an Express api, a python daemon for data-processing, and a MongoDB database. The documentation has been written using sphinx, and is hosted using readthedocs.

Each of the following sections, describes these components in more detail. In particular, we focus on how these components function, how to contribute to each component, and the limitations of each of these components.
