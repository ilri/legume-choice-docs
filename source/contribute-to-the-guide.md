# Documentation

This documentation was created using sphinx and is hosted on readthedocs. The repository for this documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/l-gorman/legume-choice-docs). The markdown files which contain the content can all be found in the `source` directory. To add new sections to the documentation, add a new markdown (or RST) file to the source directory, and refer to the file in the toctree (found in the `index.rst` file) to ensure it is included in the table of contents.
