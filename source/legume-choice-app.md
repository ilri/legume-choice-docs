# Using the App

This section provides an overview of how to get started with the LegumeCHOICE app. The app can be viewed and downloaded [here](https://l-gorman.github.io/legume-choice-client/). To download the application, visit the page. To the right of the URL (in the search bar) there should be a button to download in the app. If you are having trouble downloading the app, try updating your browser.

When using the app, you will be directed to the "information" page. We recommend reading the description of the tool, and downloading the original guide. To navigate between different parts of the application, open the menu using the button in the top-left corner. The pages are arranged in the order that the data should be collected (i.e. begin at the top and work your way down through each item).

Note that there is a toolbar at the top of the page with the categories "Project", "Project Information", "Legume Information", "Data Entry", and "Results". Each category should be followed by "?". "Project" will be followed by the project name, once it is entered by the user. The remaining categories will be marked as complete when the user visits each of the pages. When all of the categories are ticked, the user is able to submit their data to the legumeCHOICE database.

## Project Information

To understand how the legumeCHOICE tool is used, it is important to collect meta-data. This allows the data-collector to enter key information about themselves and the project. When the data collector first visits the page, a project ID is pre-loaded. This project ID cannot be changed and will be used to identify the dataset later on (see [public data](public-data.md) and [administrators](administrators.md))

After the user fills out the main data-entry form, they can also specify the region they are working in. The polygon mapping tool, located at the bottom of the page, allows the user to drag the corners of the polygon to specify where they are working.

## Legumes

There are 49 legumes already included in the application. To load these legumes into the application, the user must visit the legumes page. This ensures that the user looks through the legumes, and adds any relevant legumes which may be missing.

## Data Entry

This is the key section of the application. When the user visits the data-entry page, initial responses are loaded into the application. For more information on each of the data collection components, please refer to Annex 5 in the legume CHOICE guide (the guide can be downloaded at the homepage for this documentation, or it can be downloaded at the info page of the application).

### Context Scores

The Context Assessment considers a series of key constraints to legume use. The user must assign a score to each key constraint for the particular context or community being studied. This exercise is conducted separately with the 3 typology groups and the average for each attribute is the rounded average of all 6 scores (3 typologies x 2 score types per attribute).

### Pairwise Scoring

### Participatory Matrix Scoring

### AgroEcological Filter

## Limitations

-   The toolbar at the top only indicates whether the minimum amount of data required for submission has been loaded into the application. This does not indicate whether the user has modified or added any extra information.
-   The polygon mapping tool requires internet connectivity for rerendering the map.
-   The mapping tool will load with an initial global level zoom. Currently, loading the map based on user location is not possible.
-   This application has only been downloaded/used with Firefox and Chrome, it has not been tested with other browsers.
-   Currently this application is only designed to function on a computer. It is not likely to accomodate the narrower screens of mobiles and tablets.
-   The mapping tool, found in **Project Information** will only work with internet connection. We recommend mapping the area of interest before going to the field.
