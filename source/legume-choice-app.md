# Using the App

This section provides an overview of how to get started with the LegumeCHOICE app. The app can be viewed and downloaded [here](https://l-gorman.github.io/legume-choice-client/). To download the application, visit the page. To the right of the URL (in the search bar) there should be a button to download in the app. If you are having trouble downloading the app, try updating your browser.

When using the app, you will be directed to the "information" page. We recommend reading the description of the tool, and downloading the original guide. To navigate between different parts of the application, open the menu using the button in the top-left corner. The pages are arranged in the order that the data should be collected (i.e. begin at the top and work your way down through each item).

Note that there is a toolbar at the top of the page with the categories "Project", "Project Information", "Legume Information", "Data Entry", and "Results". Each category should be followed by "?". "Project" will be followed by the project name, once it is entered by the user. The remaining categories will be marked as complete when the user visits each of the pages.

## Managing Data

## Limitations

-   The toolbar at the top only indicates whether the minimum amount of data required for submission has been loaded into the application. This does not indicate whether the user has modified or added any extra information.
-   This application has only been downloaded/used with Firefox and Chrome, it has not been tested with other browsers.
-   Currently this application is only designed to function on a computer. It is not likely to accomodate the narrower screens of mobiles and tablets.
-   The mapping tool, found in **Project Information** will only work with internet connection. We recommend mapping the area of interest before going to the field.
