# Background

LegumeCHOICE is a participatory tool to fit multi-purpose legumes to appropriate niches in mixed crop-livestock farming systems. It is a participatory approach to making informed decisions, with farmers, about which legume types and species would be most appropriate to meet their livelihood needs. The simple concept underlying the tool is that different legume types fulfil different functions within farms and that by matching legume types with the functions demanded by farmers a sensible set of legume options can be tested and refined at farm level.
