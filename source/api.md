# API

The API used for this project is a very simple express API. The API can be cloned [here](https://github.com/l-gorman/legume-choice-api). Clone the repository, change to the project directory using the command `cd legume-choice-api` and ensure dependencies are installed using the command `npm install`. The database models can be found in the `models` folder, and the routes in the `routes` folder. The api can be started using the command `node server.js` (it will run on port 5000 by default).
